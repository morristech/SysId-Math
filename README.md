## SysId-Math ##

**SysId-Math** is an Android 4+ application created during my final study project. It implements variety of mathematical functions connected with [system identification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_identification).

It was designed as simple tool that allows users to process logged data and adapt mathematical models (eg. ARX, ARMAX) to it.
